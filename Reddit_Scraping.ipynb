I have no particular issue with people who misinterpret what I\\'m trying to say - I\\'m more than willing to explain further.  But when it becomes apparent that they\\'re not misinterpreting it, but misrepresenting it, I have no interest in continuing, at all, and that specifically because those people cannot be reached.  There\\'s no combination of words and ideas that are going to get through to them because it\\'s not that they aren\\'t grasping the idea, but that they will not even consider it.\\n\\n>Amathia = ‘disknowledge’ instilled into the soul by bad upbringing and bad education, consisting in false values and notions and beliefs.\\n\\nWhile it likely plays a role in at least most cases, and might well be the primary cause in many cases, I don\\'t think that \"bad upbringing and bad education\" is really at the heart of this.  I mean - I guess a case might be made that it is insofar as people aren\\'t brought up or educated to avoid this trap, but I think the trap is primarily psychological, so it\\'s a bit more fundamental than what is generally thought of as \"upbringing\" and \"education.\"\\n\\nI would say that, and rather obviously really, the thing that most consistently leads to amathia is identification with a particular viewpoint.  That\\'s really the key, and that\\'s the thing that needs to be avoided in order to avoid amathia.\\n\\nWhat I mean by that:\\n\\nThere\\'s essentially a hierarchy of ways in which one can approach ideas.  From best to worst:\\n\\n1) By considering the merits and likelihood of individual ideas.\\n\\n2) By believing in the validity of one idea.\\n\\n3) By holding one broad position.\\n\\n4) By identifying with one ideology.\\n\\nAt each stage, there\\'s additional psychological investment in a position regarding the idea, and it\\'s that psychological investment that, in my opinion, really drives amathia (and is the primary factor behind the hierarchy).  That is exactly how and why intelligent people come to hold destructive and invalid ideas - simply because they have a stake in them.  It\\'s not just a matter of considering ideas and weighing their merits and likelihood, but of maintaining a self-image.  By the time it gets to the point at which people have defined themselves as \"____ists,\" the idea is no longer even the primary consideration - they are overtly no longer talking about the idea, but about themselves - the idea is secondary at best.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s as that psychological investment grows that people become more likely to engage in the sort of intellectual dishonesty that characterizes amathia.  That is, I would say, the real driving force.\\n\\nAnd again, it might be argued that upbringing and education can and should counter that, but it seems to me that, at best, we\\'re a considerable distance from being able to even begin to accomplish that.  It\\'s going to require some fundamental changes in the human psyche and in human civilization, such that people no longer feel such a need to invest themselves in positions - to stake some part of their self-images on the wearing of an ideological label.\\n\\n>You may be familiar with philosopher Hannah Arendt’s famous description of what most Nazi bureaucrats did as the “banality of evil.” She was criticized for that phrase...\\n\\nI\\'ve never looked into it closely, but I had no idea that she was criticized for that.  I\\'ve always thought it was rather insightful - that it neatly pointed out what seemed to me to be obviously true - that the Nazis were not some sort of EEE-vil supervillains, but just more or less ordinary people, caught up in a particularly nasty sort of irrationality.  Just as is the case with other people in admittedly generally (but not always) more mundane and less destructive contexts, they were invested in an ideology, and employing whatever intellectual dishonesty was necessary to protect their self-images.\\n\\n>I suggest, not just to my fellow Stoics, but to anyone interested in ethics and the human condition, that we should resurrect the word “amathia,” just like we have resurrected “eudaimonia,” because it is a crucial concept for which — interestingly — there is no adequate English translation, or comparable concept in the English language.\\n\\nI wholeheartedly agree that it should be resurrected, and I\\'d only add that I\\'m enough of a cynic that I sort of chuckle over the mild observation that there\\'s \"interestingly\" no adequate English translation.  I would\\'ve been tempted to use something more pointed there, like \"conveniently\" or even \"likely not accidentally,\" since I\\'d say that it\\'s rather obvious that there are a great many people who achieve and hold positions of power and privilege *specifically* by taking advantage of the human proclivity for amathia.\\n\\nI\\'ll definitely do my part to resurrect the term.  Much of the focus of my thinking over the years has been the ways in which, and the reasons why, people limit and cripple their own thinking, but even with that, I\\'d never before encountered the word \"amathia.\"  It will certainly become a part of my vocabulary.',\n",

For example, most libertarians/conservatives believe that the free market is the solution to nearly all market based problems, while liberal democrats believe the free market is the best solution for many, but not all market based problems. On the other end, communists believe the free market is the best solution to very few or no market based problems. I would argue though that the conservative stance and the communist stance is far more ideological since this mean that a libertarian/conservative will be skeptical to a fault when it comes to non free market based solutions and communists will be skeptical to a fault when it comes to free market based solutions. Liberals will be less likely to be unnecessarily skeptical of either since they believe either free market or non free market solutions may be applicable. \\n      \\nTake for example healthcare. There is clear empiric evidence that the US system costs more money and produces worse outcomes than any other developed nations government funded healthcare systems. Yet conservatives refuse to entertain any bill that attempts to let the government intervene in healthcare on a mass scale, despite conservatives being generally supportive of more accessible healthcare and equitable healthcare outcomes. The free market ideology blinds them from looking at non free market solutions. *Edit: on the other hand liberals generally support free trade, a free market solution, but also support socialized medicine.      \\n      \\nNow of course there are areas where liberals are more ideological than conservatives, but when it comes to economic issues the conservative ideology prevents many of them from empirically looking at evidence that goes against it.

The university submitted 60 programs to the competition, which were designed to recognize each other through a series of five to ten moves at the start. Once this recognition was made, one program would always cooperate and the other would always defect, assuring the maximum number of points for the defector. If the program realized that it was playing a non-Southampton player, it would continuously defect in an attempt to minimize the score of the competing program. As a result, this strategy ended up taking the top three positions in the competition, as well as a number of positions towards the bottom.\\n\\nSOURCE: [Wikipedia: Prisoners Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#The_iterated_prisoner.27s_dilemma)\",\n",

One of the things we studdied was game theory and things like the prisoners delima. Our \"exam\" for the unit was a game, a simple game. Everyone could choose A or B, if everyone chose B, everyone failed the unit and got no points. If everyone chose A, everyone passed the unit with the normal amount of points (it was a points added grade system). However, if even one person chose B, and at least one berson chose A, then the person(s) who chose A would get no points, and the person(s) who chose B got double the points. I sat there, listening to everyone discuss, and I came to a conclusion- it would be easier and better for future interactions with my class if I chose A, and let them all know that I had, and that they should choose B. So I did. It was interesting.\\n\\nI bring this up because between this fun game, and my experience in college, I have had the concept of game theory driven home.

CopyCat is doesn\\'t have the \"once\" part but there is a bootstrapping issue with your first play if you are iterative but not N-->∞ where Tit-for-Tat has \"communication advantages\" as a 2nd order effect.  But either is better than the rest!\\n\\nThe part I found \"foul\" when I learned this in MBA school was that there\\'s another game called \"Prisoner\\'s Dilemma\" which usually suggests \"Defection is optimal\".  This was proven by Nash (of \"Beautiful Mind\" fame).  BUT PD is **only a single play game where you NEVER see or play your opponent ever again**.  \\n\\nFor example Cold War MADD was Prisoner Dilemma with Nash Criteria BUT you can only play that once - the world is destroyed after one play of Defect.  \\n\\nThe \"foul\" part in my MBA was that once most people heard about Nash Criteria and how \"defecting\" *could sometimes be optimal*, they stopped listening to the lecture and ignored the part of it being a \"single play\" game only.  Their eyes glazed over in an ecstasy of \"mathematically justified greed\" except NOPE, that\\'s not even wrong!!\\n\\nSo in economics or business, just when would PD be correct?   Clearly in cases when you never see the other party ever again and never play again.  \\n\\nSo the one scenario I use: imagine you are on vacation on the other side of the world and while wandering in some unknown corner or some unknown city, a street urchin comes up to sell you a carved wooden elephant - that is PD territory.

We have maintained above-average test scores in our area everywhere but the past five or six years, which have shown a steady decline in  standardized test scores and thus, a staunching of school funds; not to mention the state that I live in has not had a proper budget for a very long time at this point. Needless to say, we\\'re broke.\\n\\nOne of the most recent standardized tests I can remember taking in school was called the PARCC, and it was dreaded by our district. Schools in our area did horribly on this test, to the point where som layoffs occurred because of poor results. I took the test in the Math and English department last year, and I remember one thing very prominently about the whole experience; nobody, not even the teachers, cared.\\n\\nWe went through about three weeks of training for the test, where we practiced curricula I had never learned, and that seemed far above my level to learn. I\\'ve taken every advanced class available to me and have tried to learn as much as possible from said classes, but I didn\\'t understand well over half of the test. When I asked what I was going to do, I was unanimously responded with \"Try your Best.\"\\n\\nI later realized that the reason our faculty cared so little about the test was because it was being de-legitimized by teaching unions to the point where results likely would not matter. So, when test day came around, I tried my best. My results showed that, while I did poorly (as expected), I did far better than nearly every other student at my school, including ones in calculus and other higher classes. Why? Because nobody cared.\\n\\nI feel like a similar apathy is prominent in education; to the point where teachers do what they must to maintain their job and little more. That same math teacher who cared so little got a master\\'s in statistics and immediately moved to a much better school, where they were being payed well over double what our district offered, and she had added benefits. While I do not have any knowledge of the struggles or issues this person faced, my experience told me they did not deserve to be teaching any higher classes when all they cared about was maintaining scores, to the point where she didn\\'t even teach us more than we absolutely needed to pass the class.\\n\\nTo avoid more personal spite, I\\'ll close; in my own personal experience, critical thinking and personal growth mean NOTHING to some educators.

              " 'For those interested in a broader critique of moral arguments against recreational drug use, see Rob Lovering\\'s book A Moral Defense of Recreational Drug Use (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015).  From the back cover: \"Why does American law allow the recreational use of some drugs, such as alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine, but not others, such as marijuana, cocaine, and heroin? The answer lies not simply in the harm the use of these drugs might cause, but in the perceived morality--or lack thereof--of their recreational use. Despite strong rhetoric from moral critics of recreational drug use, however, it is surprisingly difficult to discern the reasons they have for deeming the recreational use of (some) drugs morally wrong. In this book, Rob Lovering lays out and dissects various arguments for the immorality of using marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and other drugs recreationally. He contends that, by and large, these arguments do not succeed. Lovering\\'s book represents one of the first works to systematically present, analyze, and critique arguments for the moral wrongness of recreational drug use. Given this, as well as the popularity of the morality-based defense of the United States\\' drug laws, this book is an important and timely contribution to the debate on the recreational use of drugs.\" ',\n",
              " \"Calling opiate addiction (really, tolerance and dependence, a distinction must be made between addiction and dependence, though it's not material here) a disease is fine. \\n\\nAddiction is absolutely not a moral failure and viewing it as a disease to be treated is infinitely more rational and compassionate than the way that judge and legislator in the article conceive it. \\n\\nThe author was correct to single out the 'wanting system' as he called it, and for a popular article not primarily about neurophysiology, I think that is a fair thing to do. \\n\\nAddiction is a type of disease we don't really have a word for. It is an induced network error in the reward/reinforcement circuitry of the nucleus accumbans shell-ventral tegmental area-hippocampus recurrent connections. Specifically of the projection neurons of the accumbans that express high levels of mu opioid receptor. \\n\\nWe evolved to find specific things naturally rewarding, as the author said, we want certain things. The most powerful natural rewards are things like water, food, sex, safety, and social status, all things likely to contribute to survival and procreation. Opiates literally alter gene expression patterns in this circuit such that it re-wires itself to prioritize the acquisition of opiates above all other rewards deemed important for life, sharply discounting everything else. \\n\\nIt can take months for the opiate upregulated transcription factor responsible for causing and maintaining the bad wiring to decay to baseline levels. That's why cravings and psychological changes persist for months after the acute physical withdraws have passed (acute withdrawals have to do with cell level changes to dopamine receptors which were reduced in number and made less sensitive as an attempt to maintain homeostasis, these receptor alterations recover within 5-10 days). \\n\\nBut knowledge is power. Recognizing it as a disease is an excellent first step. Recognizing exactly what has gone wrong and how to treat it is the next step. This is an extremely complex problem and neuroscience just isn't there yet. But there are thousands of researchers working on it all the time, it's not intractable. \",\n",

The exception is of course on the relative moral weights of the actions. Eg, if you can guarantee a cure, but if requires the death of another person.. For the most part I'd say that realistic treatments will not cross this line.\\n\\nIf we care not for the addict but rather for society, then we either need to do what works, or we need to remove the addict from society. The latter is done half heartedly with prison time. Except that in prison the person still had a cozy to society and limited interaction. Also the person  will rejoin society at some point in most cases. So, again, we are left doing what works, or being morally deficient ourselves. \\n\\nIf we care not for society nor the addict, then we care for our own sake. The a arguments remain the same.\\n\\nSo then the only question becomes, what works? While it now becomes tempting to base treatments on moral grounds the same arguments hold. Just as we wouldn't kill one poison to save another because the moral weight of the actions do not match. Denying an effective treatment on the basis of moral grounds is pure hypocrisy when the treatment works. Especially if the reasoning is that the treatment used alternative drugs, since then we have one evil against the sand evil tempered by a good.\\n\\nIf we care not for helping the addict, then we need not talk about treatment at all.

This seems almost like the author has tried to force their idea into the format of the apocryphal Stalin quote “If only one man dies of hunger, that is a tragedy. If millions die, that’s only statistics.” But it just doesn\\'t make sense, because the author is now talking about causality, rather than merely how we might describe the phenomenon of mental illness. Clearly, at no point in history, has a single person been depressed, it has always been some \"mass\". So we can infer nothing of the causality of depression from this.\\n\\nThe argument, I suppose, is that something about our modern society is causing mental illness at a *higher rate* than it should or could be. Though the argument is only really implied, and is effectively absent from the article in any concrete form.

Which doesn\\'t sound much like Hegel\\'s definition at all. And that\\'s entirely aside from the actual statistics WHO use, which I assume are the vastly more \"medicalised\" materialist definitions outlined in the DSM-V and used with variable accuracy and interpretations by clinicians (and reported with variable veracity by individual local and national medical authorities) before being distilled by the WHO into an alarming, but not actually very illuminating, single statistic. And lumping in \"substance use\" (not even substance doesn\\'t *abuse*) doesn\\'t help us understand what\\'s going on with these statistics at all. \\n\\nThe authors conclusions are simply not connected to the body of the article. What definition of mental health do they propose, Hegel\\'s (loose) definition, the WHOs, something in between? And if the definition is so vague, where is the evidence that, by any particular definition, mental illness is rising or is higher than you would expect in a \"healthy\" society? Where is the evidence that this is because of broad social issues, as opposed to any one of numerous confounding factors, such as more awareness, acceptance, and reporting, or a misalignment between reporting and the actual definition used?

(Due to the [neo-liberalism](https://theconversation.com/how-neoliberalism-is-damaging-your-mental-health-90565)\\nthat brought capitalism to every corner of the planet just so, for example, we can have 11 year olds making our clothing.)\\n\\n***But we should be thinking about these things.***\\nAnd even though individuals alone are hardly to [blame](https://i.imgur.com/Xgv4O75.jpg), some of us still, I feel, carry that guilt with us, whether consciously or subconsciously, and no amount of therapy will change the fact that it is *wrong* - and we *still* feel powerless, while corporations shift the blame to our lifestyles, but at the same time they are telling us to 'drive less', they are also encouraging us to [have more kids](https://i.imgur.com/vxzWUAc.jpg) to buy their shit. \\n\\nAnd then when it comes to not winning an unwinnable rat race: \\n\\n&amp;gt;Depression in this context may appear almost self-protective: an opt-out from an unwinnable set of continual competitions.\\xa0\\n\\n&amp;gt;But this falsehood of “free choice” demotivates and depoliticises. In such a world, depression, anxiety, narcissism (the primitive defence of the infantile self against overwhelming attack) are entirely logical responses. It has been\\xa0confirmed\\xa0that neoliberal societies make their citizens physically as well as mentally sick; the effect is magnified the more unequal the society and the more unprotected its citizens from free-market “competitiveness”.\\n\\nBottom line: We feel guilty because we are guilty, but we are stuck in a system where any hope of opting out successfully is basically nil. I also, of course, believe we should help ourselves, if possible, before we can help our communities and the rest of the world - but **the Western models of behavioral and emotional therapy (including DBT, or Dialectic Based Therapy) are basically asking us to deny reality and remain integrated and invested in a society *we should absolutely* find cruel and unjust.**\\n\\nDepressive realism somewhat allows some of us to be a little more realistic about what we are doing and the ripple effect our lives have. And I don't feel many models of therapy address this - but I would love to be wrong. \\n\\n**There is a ton of shit to be fucking sad about. \\nSome people don't 'get better' and are sick of this shit show. So they choose to die. Nothing 'crazy' about that.**\\n\\nFrom this [article](https://www.madinamerica.com/2017/08/mad-world/) :\\n\\n&amp;gt;“Many people believe, and are encouraged to believe, that these problems and disorders – psychosis, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, self-harm – these symptoms of a ‘sick world’ (to use James Hillman’s terrific description) are theirs, rather than the world’s. \\n\\n&amp;gt;‘But what if your emotional problems weren’t merely your own?’, asks Tom Syverson. ‘What if they were\\xa0our\\xa0problems?

It’s another thing to be clinically depressed—as in completely unmotivated, no energy, laying in bed all day because you can’t get out, no appetite, poor concentration, no sleep.

We already know from randomized controlled trials that our typical antidepressants are probably a little better for placebo but are more meaningfully better than placebo when treating more severe cases of clinical depression. What most people who are “depressed” need is not a pill but an examination of what is missing in their lives.

And, at that moment, it is so tempting to just find some pedantic quibble or make some snarky remark to avoid engaging with it.\\n\\nAt that point, if you truly believe in what you're arguing, that's the moment you have to find the will to really make an effort to understand the other point of view and counter it at its best.  It's like a tree needing wind to grow stronger; your argument needs stiff resistance to be its best.\",\n",
              " 'This is a way too long story about the greatest teacher I\\'ve ever known:\\n\\nI taught middle school science at a poorly performing inner city school for a while. The city would grade your school based on the pass rate on the state wide exam at the end of the year. Before I started the science pass rate was about 50%, and it was about 30-35% in English and math. I was able to raise that score in science to 82%, which was great. \\n\\nHowever, our social studies pass rate was 98%. We were a small school with about 40 students per grade (middle school was 6, 7, 8). I think there were only 3 that did not pass my first year. I couldn\\'t believe those stats, so I sat in on some of the social study classes. Their teacher would cover a historical event in the curriculum, and then have each student write a short essay arguing for or against a statement he would provide. For example he would have a statement like \"the Roman army was the greatest in history\". He would leave it intentionally vague and ask students to form an opinion and write a page or so defending their position. Then he would read their arguments and assign them to two teams. One in support of the statement, and one against. \\n\\nThey would have a few days to research and refine their arguments, and then they would hold a Socratic seminar. Each student would have to individually argue a certain point against someone on the other team (e.g. the Mongolian army conquered more land, so they should be considered greater). \\n\\nIt was amazing to see it in action. These were kids that were 12-15 years old, and some of them were reading on a second grade level. But during the debate, they spoke with conviction and were held entirely accountable for their position. You couldn\\'t slack off and not do your research. If you did, you\\'d recieve a zero for the entire week or so and would have to stay late everyday until you actually did the work. Plus, nobody wanted to stand up in front of the class and look dumb. These kids loved to argue, and he used that to their advantage. \\n\\nMy favorite part, and the reason this post made me thing of this story, is that if someone brought up a really interesting point, or two students really seemed convicted about their argument, he would have them switch positions. Right in the middle of their debate they would have to take on the opponent\\'s side. Because of this, each person had to research both sides to every argument. ',\n",

At the same time, the discursive articulation of other\\'s case would presume or instantiate a respect that exceeds any particular argument, which is nonviolence and good will.

They may, of course, proceed with violence, but they cannot extricate themselves from the condition of respect so easily. \\n\\nSo imagine someone gets arrested protesting Republicare, but does a in a \"WFS\", that is, a well formed satyagraha. This is one in which the respect is maintained to the highest degree. It is this particular respect that, as respect, presumes the other\\'s strongest argument. But this all occurs in the context in which that about which there is disagreement pertains to the policies that affect both parties and may be enforced directly, and where there may not be free speech or room for dialogue. Yet we may imagine that in the overall political conditions the respectful \"strongest argument\" had been articulated in one setting or another, such as letters to the editor or as press conference. \\n\\nRespectful maintenance or holding to truth, however, does not amount to the oppression other coming around/agreeing. But agreeing doesn\\'t amount to overall respect, either. \\n\\nIdeally both would be there, but things are rarely ideal.
