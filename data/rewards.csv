"In the absence of a god, is anything truly good or bad?","In the absence of a god, is anything truly good or bad? That depends entirely on how you look at it.

The point of atheism is not to promote godly or moral values or any other kind of deity. That argument's only on the one hand an attack on the idea that God is the creator of reality, and that he made all things, not just our reality, and we should not use it to justify ""godless"" atheism. On the other hand, atheism is",1.0
"In the absence of a god, is anything truly good or bad?","In the absence of a god, is anything truly good or bad? I don't see any reason why so-called naturalists would argue that the universe is simply in a state of infinite complexity and no one should be so easily drawn to this world of absolute truth, as that is what we all call God. Therefore, the best thing I can say over this whole thing is that there is no reason to dismiss the universe as an illusion, either. As a matter of fact, it is quite",0.5
"In the absence of a god, is anything truly good or bad?","In the absence of a god, is anything truly good or bad? The most effective way to answer these questions is to choose an action, and do the deed by a simple act. There is no ""bad"" action or ""bad"" actions, there is only a ""good"" action or ""bad"" actions. In the context of an action, a good action is a good thing, and a bad action is an evil thing. A good action is not good because it kills or injures",0.0
"Does life have meaning? if yes, what is it? and does it matter?","Does life have meaning? if yes, what is it? and does it matter? but then it is like saying death is a matter of life? life doesn't matter. I cannot help it if I don't speak your language.

I have seen more than 1,000 people die there. How are your efforts to help them understand the words of those who die there? there is no hope. there is only pain. the pain that comes from the death is the only pain, because",1.0
"Does life have meaning? if yes, what is it? and does it matter?","Does life have meaning? if yes, what is it? and does it matter?

It can make the difference on the surface between life, and death. The 'love of death' is not the thing that defines a person. It is no one of 'death', but another that is just as different as being 'one of 'death'.

This is a powerful, powerful, but very very important argument. If you want to use it for the purpose of your book, then",0.5
"Does life have meaning? if yes, what is it? and does it matter?","Does life have meaning? if yes, what is it? and does it matter? where does it end and what is our purpose? Does life have meaning? whether life has meaning, the right answer or not?

I'm not talking about the human mind. There are humans who have learned to use language, and all they can agree on is that they have lost that ability to read a sentence when speaking English. They have lost their ability to think quickly, and their abilities to take in",0.0
When should you change your mind?,"When should you change your mind?

You don't have to change your mind. I am happy that the majority of the people in the world are not happy with what we are doing. If you don't believe me, your child may start to doubt you. But if you are doing something about these issues, you may just end up changing your mind.

People who care deeply about this issue are most often kids. They don't understand why people feel alienated. Sometimes, they just",1.0
When should you change your mind?,"When should you change your mind? You might find it hard to put it all into perspective until you're trying to figure out what are the rules you should follow.

When do you start to think differently about your parenting?

How about when you get a new roommate? You might find that it's easier to be open and honest in your assessment about your son's behavior.
